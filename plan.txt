[+] Create a full stack app using React, MongoDB, and Nodejs.
[+] Create an admin login and a user login with complete 
    [+] registration, 
    [+] authorization, 
    [+] email verification, 
    [.] and forgot password system.
[.] After logging in, 
    [+] users should be able to view the available pizza varieties in the dashboard.
    [.] Also, users can start making the custom pizza with the following flow.
        [+] Choose any pizza base from 5 options.
        [+] Next, choose any sauce from 5 options.
        [+] Select a cheese type from 4 options.
        [.] Opt veggies from many options.
        [.] Choose meat from many options.
        [.] Make sure users can choose three free veggies and one free meat. 
        [.] On adding extra veggies and meat, charge them accordingly. 
            [.] Also, display the charges.
[+] In the admin login, 
    [+] create a mini inventory management system keeping track of available pizza base, sauce, cheese, veggies, and meat.
    [+] Then after an order, update the necessary changes in stock and present them in the admin dashboard.
[.] Schedule a notification to the admin email id when the available stock goes beyond the threshold value. (e.g. the total pizza base is below 20 after so many consecutive orders, trigger an email)
[+] Admin must receive the order and change the status of the pizza- as order received, In the kitchen, and Sent to delivery.
[+] So, for every update from the admin, the status change must be reflected in the user dashboard.
[.] Also, integrate polling for pizza status updates from client to server.
